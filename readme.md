# Flowchart for AP Chemistry Quantitative Analysis Lab

See the flowchart [here](flowchart.svg).

Also included:
* The Graphviz source for the flowchart
* A super short Bash script to render the flowchart from the source file
* A Python script which converts user-typed LaTeX-style (super/sub)scripts to Unicode (super/sub)scripts; very helpful for formatting chemical formulas
